# Arch
Arch is a great way to learn linux as it forces you the user to configure your OS from almost scratch. However, it can be daunting to brand new users. For that I created a Wiki page to walk you through the whole process. Also, for those who are used to Arch I created a script to automate the install with UEFI boot. 

## Install Script
The install script is meant to automate the installation process of Arch when needing UEFI boot.

WARNING: PLEASE REVIEW ENTIRE SCRIPT PRIOR TO EXECUTION

To download the script to your brand new Arch OS run:

```
curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paragonsec/Arch/master/Install/install.sh
```
Change the variables at the top of the script and execute.

## Future Additions
I plan on cleaning up the script a tad and add post installation scripts to automate the install of a DE and WM. If you have any suggestions please just let me know. Also, if anything is wrong with the script please open an issue and I will address it as quick as I can.

Thanks!
